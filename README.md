My very first Kotlin Android app built as an application for connecting people around the globe. This application allows users to create their own groups based on their interests and to join other groups similarly. The last stage of this application involved completed login function, completed profile page, profile switch feature using profile picture long press/double tap similar to instagram, chat page built similar to instagram with animated text backgrounds, group info page listing all the users and ability to remove and add users. Feature to search existing groups and users in the app along with sending the group requests to join the group.

P.S. this is a new repository where I have uploaded cleaned code from 2 years ago.
